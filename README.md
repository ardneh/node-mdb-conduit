This node modules makes MongoDB's (http://mongodb.org) aggregate pipeline (henceforce `pipeline`) avaiable for use in Node.

Potential uses:
* Provide a common API to query data in an application (one DSL).
* Quickly imeplement
* Post-processing of data returned by MongoDB.
* Pre-processing of pipelines sent to MongoDB.
* Test out ideas for new pipeline functionality.

Todo

High
----
* Try the https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson node module and if it's at least close to as fast as v8ToMongo, get rid of MongoV8Helpers.
  Otherwise, rename MongoV8Helpers to someone meaningful (all it does/should do is convert from V8 types <-> BSON).
* Make it extentable (DocumentSources, Pipeline, etc...) preferably both from C++ AND node.
* Enable veryfy(), *assert(),
* Try to re-use MongoDB's pipeline test cases.
* Remove #if 0 blocks from MongoV8Helpers.
* Rename v8ToMongo* to v8ToBson*. 
* Make using "copies" in gyp to copy over _all_ of the mongo cpp files we use (db/pipeline, ...) into src/mongo.
  and add those new files to our sources.
* Stop linking with ALL mongo libs.  We should be compiling everything we need directly.

Medium
------
* Only include (build) the files we actually need from MongoDB (mostly in pipeline/).
  - Do not actually link any MongoDB libraries.  Watch out for the one case where we need to include
    a file that is generated by mongo's build.  Hopefully we won't need that.
* Provide our own DocumentSource based on node streams or something so we can pass items through a pipeline
  as they become available.
* Emit node events via our own special output DocumentSource to make output async (also keep sync mode accessable).
* Make a base class for MongoDB's scripting V8Scope class (in mongo/scripting/engine_v8.*) that we can use for
  convertion V8 object to and from BSON.
  - Make the relevant items in src/mongo/scripting/v8_db.* either take the new base class instead of Scope* 
    or make them templates so they can accept either (as long as in MongoDB and in our code only one set ever
	get instantiated.
